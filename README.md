This is the public repository of **harbour-colorchooser**, a simple RGB color chooser app for *SailfishOS* (that is the operating system running on Jolla phones). The **Colour Chooser** app submitted to the *SailfisOS Harbour* recently is build using this sources.

Feel free to consult the source code for learning more about writing QML apps using JavaScript – not only restricted to SailfishOS apps.

## Description
This simple app lets you choose a RGB colour by mixing the portions of red, green and blue. Each colour has its slider ranging from 0 to 255. The current colour is displayed in a small box as well as on the application cover page. For the ones memorizing their colour triplets, you also can fill them in – or use the text field for copy and paste.
